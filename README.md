# clojure-noob

Project is my personal tries to understand and study how to program on clojure. It contains 
some my comments/notes about process of studying, steps and some examples which I wrote
to prove some new knowledge.  

For that project I selected next tasks for demonstration:
- simplest io walker which could most frequent used word throw files
- rest endpoints with GET methods to get some information about file system  
- make some tests  

## Description

If you are interesting in some my comments and copypastes of clojure listings 
from other sites... then just read it. Order is next:
- I started from syntax understanding, sources are in clojure_noob.syntax package
- next I decided to use tests to continue check opportunities of language  
I think it is perfect when standard sdk has tests internally. So will use them. 
First entries I decided to make based on some task which could show that I understood 
syntax and could now write something (see description)
